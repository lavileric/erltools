/* EXTENSION of usability. */  
/* Author Eric Lavillonnière */

Erltools software has been distributed from 1989 to 2018 under GPLV1.0. I decide
to extend it usability, from now on, by allowing at your convenience, if the terms
are more favorable to your usage, also to use it under the term of  LGPL-3.0-or-later.
